# Virtual-Contest-Challenge
I am Saumel. 
Today 5th January, I am starting a challenge to participate in one virtual contest every single day, except on my exam days or days when there are official contests on online platforms such as Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder. My goal is to complete at least 100 virtual contest.
